# SmartPark Assistant

## Overview
SmartPark Assistant is an Arduino-based project designed to provide real-time parking feedback using an ultrasonic sensor, LED, and buzzer. The system offers accurate and responsive assistance by blinking the LED and emitting distinct beeps based on object proximity. Enhance parking safety with this compact and versatile solution.

## Features
- Ultrasonic sensor for precise distance measurement.
- LED indicator for visual feedback.
- Buzzer with various beep patterns indicating proximity.
- Designed for accuracy and responsiveness in parking scenarios.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Arduino board
- Ultrasonic sensor
- LED
- Buzzer
- Jumpers and resistors (as per the circuit)
  
### Installation
